# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Demo

This is a **teaser demo** showcasing how MCP servers and tools integrate with GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to connect to external tools and data sources. MCP servers expose capabilities (tools, prompts, resources) that Copilot can invoke to extend its functionality beyond code understanding.

## Demo Focus

This demo walks through:
- Enabling the MCP servers gallery in VS Code
- Installing a trusted MCP server from the registry
- Invoking MCP tools in Copilot Chat
- Interpreting tool results

## Quick Start

See [TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md) for the complete setup guide and demo playbook.
